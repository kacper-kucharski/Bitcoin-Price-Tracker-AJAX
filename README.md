# Bitcoin-Price-Tracker-AJAX

In this small project I have created an small single page app that check bitcoin price. 
For this project I used the AJAX workflow to pull data from an API without constantly refreshing the page. 
I have also implemented animation calling for the loading bar so that I can restart the animation after everytime a button is pressed.
The Languages used in this project were HTML, CSS, Javascript.

You can check the app out: https://kacper-kucharski.github.io/Bitcoin-Price-Tracker-AJAX/
